								<h3>Database</h3>
								<p><span class="image fit"><img src="images/databaseImage.jpg" alt="database" /></span></p>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/bankER.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									For this project, I created a database utilizing PHPmyadmin with the idea that the database itself
									would be applicable to real-world scenarios such as a Bank or a similar organization's system. 
									The project saw me demonstrate numerous SQL statements meant to communicate with an independent 
									website. Essentially, the scenario can be described as follows:
									"A bank company is headquartered in a certain town and state, and has multiple branches throughout
									the country. Each branch oversees operations over their own customers and employees local to Each
									branch. Customers can bank at multiple locations, while each employee is tied to a specific branch.
									A customer can also have multiple accounts and multiple loans at one time, with joint ownership of
									an account being possible between multiple customers. To change the amount of an account, customers 
									must complete transactions (intersection data). Active customers are required to have at least one
									account open, with no minimum on loans. Employees oversee management of their assigned customer accounts
									and bank managers oversee what employee is responsible for which accounts. Branch managers and 
									employees come in pairs."

								<h3>Stock Web Scraper</h3>
								<p><img src="images/stockpic.jpg" alt="stock" style="max-width: 100%;max-height: Auto;" />
									<br></br>
									For this project, I created a python script that would act as a stock scraper, collecting data from a finance stock
									screener and displaying that data on any given category in real time. The categories include top
									gainers/losers, most volatile and/or high volume stocks, etc. The data is then translated then 
									displayed either in the execution terminal or an excel spreadsheet that allows for updates.

								<h3>COSC 2336: Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
								<p>
									This programming oriented class with an emphasis on C++ included topics such as hash tables, 
									binary search trees, analysis of algorithm efficiency, recursion, queues, stacks, linked lists,
									as well as address variables.

								<h3>Automated Happy Birthday Email</h3>
								<p><span class="image fit"><img src="images/email_code.jpg" alt="database" style="max-width: 100%;max-height: Auto;"/> <br></br></span></p>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/email_form.jpg" alt="database" style="max-width: 100%;max-height: Auto;"/> <br></br></span></p>
								<p>
									During my final year in high school, I created a program in JavaScript that utilized G-Suite, the 
									Google ecosystem, to automatically send a happy birthday email to students and faculty on their birthday.
									The first iteration I made relied on an initial Google form sent to students that would then prompt
									users several simple birthday related questions that would then be used to customize a digital 
									greeting card that would be sent on the user's date of birth. A later iteration required users to
									enter their email into a spreadsheet as a way to opt-in for the birthday email. I unfortunately lost
									the code while transfering my student account data to my personal computer but the trial and error 
									experience I gained from this project was crucial to me in moving forward with Computer Science and 
									the problem solving process in general.

								<h3>High School History Game</h3>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/game.jpg" alt="database" style="max-width: 100%;max-height: Auto;"/> <br></br></span></p>
								<p><span class="image fit"><img src="images/sprboy1.png" alt="database" style="max-width: 50%;max-height: Auto;"/></span> <br></br></p>
								<p>
									The very last project I worked on as a high schooler saw me working together with a group of two others to create
									a Java based, text focused game meant to assist middle school history students affected by COVID. The code relied 
									on numerous classes and functions within those classes to successfully create a working product. The project as a 
									whole taught me the importance of communication within a group setting as well as a great deal about inheritance 
									between classes. The code can still be ran in a Java compiler.

								<h3>Weighted/Unweighted GPA Calculator</h3>
								<p><span class="image fit"><img src="images/gpaCalc1.jpg" alt="database" style="max-width: 70%;max-height: Auto;"/> <br></br></span></p>
								<p><span class="image fit"><img src="images/gpaCalc2.jpg" alt="database" style="max-width: 70%;max-height: Auto;"/> <br></br></span></p>
								<p>
									<br></br>
									One of my simpler projects high school projects saw me utilizing Excel spreadsheet functions in order to create a GPA 
									calculator. It's fairly straight forward with output being given once the user has input grade values
									for the classes they entered. A second iteration took class weights into account. I also lost this code
									due to an error in data transfer.

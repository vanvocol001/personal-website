                    to customize the editor as a whole to your own liking. The connection to Github is also extremely useful.

                    type large paragraphs such as these. The method of website previewing also requires an additional browser
                tab which is usually the case, but loses out to an editor such as Atom which offers the preview within the editor.</td>
